                        <p>
                            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details
                            that can get overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like
                            Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization,
                            build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?

                        <h3>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h3>
                        <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering 
                            with its functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient 
                            of your code and the more often you do it, your code will continually be updatedint
                            a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, 
                            one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures 
                            your code remains free from plagiarism.

                            f their valuable time in handling GUI tools than making progress on the terminal.
